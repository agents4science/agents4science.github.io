# Applications of Agentic Systems for Scientific Discovery

Our partners in the DOE Genesis Mission's Common Agentic Framework (CAF) project operate an [**Agent of the Week**](https://github.com/AI-ModCon/BaseCAF_agent_of_the_week) program to highlight interesting agentic applications.

AofW#1 is [OPAL - Plant Phenotyping Analysis Agent](https://github.com/AI-ModCon/BaseCAF_agent_of_the_week/blob/main/AotW-1-OPAL.md)
