# Applications of Agentic Systems for Scientific Discovery

This directory contains example applications demonstrating multi-agent systems for scientific discovery.

## Examples

### [PolynomialDiscovery](./PolynomialDiscovery/)

Multiple autonomous agents collaboratively learn a hidden cubic polynomial through noisy observations and peer-to-peer communication. Demonstrates:
- Asynchronous multi-agent coordination
- Communication topology effects (ring vs random)
- Scaling behavior with agent count
- Collective learning from noisy data

### [RuleDiscovery](./RuleDiscovery/)

LLM-powered agents discover hidden rules governing a simulated world through experimentation and natural language communication. Demonstrates:
- LLM agents for scientific hypothesis generation
- Natural language experiment design
- Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing
- Multiple LLM backend support (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Mock)
