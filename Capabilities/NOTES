Things to fix, 2/3/26

* I'm not sure the langraph/langchain examples need to support many different versions. Can we pin to the latest version?

  - 2/23/26: Change made

* The Academy version isn't a sequential pipeline. I think it is more of a hub/spoke where the main process starts each of the agents directly and calls them without any passing of info between the agents.  Maybe this is its own pattern?

* And sequential should be another.

* I like the pattern with the 5 agents and I think that maps to examples we have seen. It may be a little overwhelming for completely new people that may have an even simpler model. E.g., LLM+Analysis like the arch picture.

* The code looks well structured to me. I defer to others with more expertise to weigh in. I wondered a little if the agent base is buying us a lot or obfuscating what is happening. But probably good design in general.

* We could extend the examples to each have either OpenAI key or FIRST token and fall back on hardcoded outputs in the case neither is provided.
