# Governance Policies for Tool Use
# Configure budget limits, rate limits, and approval requirements

budget:
  # Maximum total cost allowed (in dollars)
  limit: 100.00
  # Alert threshold (warn when this percentage is reached)
  alert_threshold: 0.80

rate_limiting:
  # Maximum number of tool calls per time window
  max_calls: 10
  # Time window in seconds

approval:
  # Tools that always require human approval
  required_for:
    - delete_data
