Challenges in CO2 conversion include: (1) the high stability of CO2 molecule
requiring significant energy input, (2) competing hydrogen evolution reaction
in aqueous systems, (3) catalyst deactivation over time, and (4) scaling up
from laboratory to industrial scale.

Room temperature CO2 conversion remains challenging due to kinetic barriers.
Photocatalytic approaches using TiO2 and related semiconductors can drive the
reaction with solar energy, but efficiencies are typically below 1%. Plasma-
assisted catalysis is an emerging approach that can activate CO2 at ambient
conditions.
