Copper-based catalysts have shown promising results for electrochemical CO2
reduction. Cu nanoparticles can achieve Faradaic efficiencies above 60% for
producing multi-carbon products like ethylene and ethanol. The selectivity
depends strongly on the catalyst morphology and oxidation state.

Recent work on copper foam electrodes demonstrates improved mass transport
and higher current densities compared to flat copper surfaces. The three-
dimensional structure provides more active sites and facilitates gas evolution.
