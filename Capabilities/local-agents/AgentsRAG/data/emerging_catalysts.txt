Recent advances in single-atom catalysts (SACs) show improved activity for
CO2 reduction. Iron and nickel SACs on nitrogen-doped carbon supports can
selectively produce CO at low overpotentials. The isolated metal sites prevent
unwanted side reactions.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer tunable pore structures for CO2 capture
and conversion. MOF-derived catalysts combine high surface area with precisely
controlled active sites. Cu-MOFs have demonstrated activity for CO2 to methanol
conversion at moderate temperatures (150-250C).
