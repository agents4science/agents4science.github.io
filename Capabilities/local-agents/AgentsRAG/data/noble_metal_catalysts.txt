Gold and silver catalysts are highly selective for CO2 reduction to CO,
achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. However, CO is a less valuable
product compared to hydrocarbons. These catalysts operate well at room
temperature in aqueous electrolytes.

The high selectivity of noble metals for CO production is attributed to
weak binding of CO intermediate, which desorbs before further reduction.
This makes them ideal for syngas production but limits hydrocarbon formation.
