# Building and Applying AI Agents for Science

An **AI agent** is an autonomous program or system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.
New **large language model** (LLM) and related technologies make it feasible to assemble collections of such agents that can automate important tasks in science and engineering, such as synthesizing information from the literature, identifying promising hypotheses, designing protocols to evaluate hypotheses, running experiments, and interpreting results.

The class is intended for graduate students and talented final year undergrads who want to engage in this fascinating research area.
We will "**learn by doing**".
Your instructors will provide infrastructure and examples, and in-depth presentations on the state of the art and open problems in agentic AI.
Students will design, build, and apply AI agents for specific purposes.
We welcome both students from **disciplines**, who may be most interested in how to apply such agents, and from **computer science**, who may be most interested in how to build such agents. We envision mutually instructive exchanges among people from diverse backgrounds.

We will organize access to powerful data and computing resources, including at the University of Chicago's [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu) and the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://alcf.anl.gov), and autonomous laboratory capabilities.

The class will take place on the Hyde Park campus of the University of Chicago during the Spring Quarter 2025, i.e., the weeks of March 24-June 7, 2025.
