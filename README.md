# Designing and Building AI Agents for Science

An AI agent is an autonomous program or system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.
New large language model (LLM) and related technologies make it feasible to assemble collections of such agents that can automate important tasks in science and engineering, such as synthesizing information from the literature, identifying promising hypotheses, designing protocols to evaluate hypotheses, and interpreting the results of experiments.

In this class, we will ``learn by doing'' in this fascinating research area.

The class will take place the Spring Quarter 2025, i.e., the weeks of March 24-June 7, 2025.
