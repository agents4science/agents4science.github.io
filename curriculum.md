# Scientific Reasoning Platform (SRP) Curriculum

This 9–week curriculum (plus a capstone sprint) teaches participants how to assemble and
use SRPs to tackle practical problems in science and engineering.

---

## Week 1: Introduction to SRPs
**Themes:**
- What is an SRP?
- Frontier reasoning models in scientific workflows.
- Motivating case studies: wildfire hazard, drug discovery, climate modeling.

**Activities:**
- Walkthrough of exemplar SRP architectures (Figure 1 + variants).
- Group discussion: participant use cases.

**Deliverable:** Short written statement of intended application area.

---

## Week 2: Reasoning-Capable AI Models
**Themes:**
- Landscape of reasoning models (frontier LLMs, domain FMs, hybrids).
- Prompting, fine-tuning, RAG, and tool-augmented reasoning.
- Trade-offs: accuracy, interpretability, efficiency.

**Activities:**
- Hands-on with different reasoning models.
- Compare model behaviors on the same scientific query.

**Deliverable:** Report comparing models on a domain-specific task.

---

## Week 3: Knowledge Organization and Access
**Themes:**
- Knowledge substrates: structured/unstructured data, embeddings, ontologies.
- Literature curation, databases, negative results.
- Query pipelines and knowledge grounding.

**Activities:**
- Build a mini-knowledge base (e.g., papers + domain DB).
- Explore semantic retrieval (vector search).

**Deliverable:** Functional knowledge index relevant to chosen domain.

---

## Week 4: Resource Integration
**Themes:**
- Linking AI to scientific resources: simulations, experimental platforms, data services.
- MCPs, APIs, workflow engines, orchestration.
- Security & authentication.

**Activities:**
- Connect an AI model to a simulation code or data API.
- Execute simple closed-loop “ask-plan-run-analyze.”

**Deliverable:** Prototype pipeline connecting a model to one external resource.

---

## Week 5: Human–AI Collaboration
**Themes:**
- Role of the scientist in the loop.
- Task delegation vs oversight.
- Trust, interpretability, and verification strategies.

**Activities:**
- Exercises in “when to trust, when to verify.”
- Design a human-in-the-loop workflow.

**Deliverable:** Human/AI task-allocation plan for participant’s domain problem.

---

## Week 6: Evaluation and Performance Assessment
**Themes:**
- Benchmarks for SRPs.
- Scientific rigor: falsifiability, reproducibility, uncertainty quantification.
- Avoiding “illusions of understanding.”

**Activities:**
- Design an evaluation protocol for SRP outputs.
- Compare ground-truth results vs SRP-generated outputs.

**Deliverable:** Draft evaluation framework applied to a sample task.

---

## Week 7: Sensitive Data, Policy, and Ethics
**Themes:**
- Working with proprietary or sensitive data.
- Data governance, privacy, reproducibility.
- Ethical use of AI in science.

**Activities:**
- Case studies (e.g., patient data, environmental risks).
- Workshop on anonymization and secure compute.

**Deliverable:** Data-handling policy for participant’s SRP.

---

## Week 8: Scaling and Automation
**Themes:**
- Scaling SRPs from single workflows to large campaigns.
- Resource scheduling, cost and carbon accounting.
- Resilience and fault tolerance.

**Activities:**
- Deploy SRP prototype on a larger dataset or HPC resource.
- Introduce automated monitoring/logging.

**Deliverable:** Scaled-up SRP experiment.

---

## Week 9: Frontier Topics & Future Directions
**Themes:**
- Agents vs SRPs, co-scientist metaphors.
- Multi-agent collaboration.
- Open challenges and research frontiers.

**Activities:**
- Roundtable on “SRPs in 2030.”
- Peer feedback on capstone plans.

**Deliverable:** Capstone project proposal.

---

## Week 10: Capstone Sprint
**Themes:**
- Integrating all components into a working SRP.

**Activities:**
- 1-week focused sprint to build and demo a domain-specific SRP.
- Peer review and presentation.

**Deliverable:** Functioning SRP demonstration + final report.
